# Projects
Neuromorphic Computing relates to work I did during my internship in the Lightwave Communications Laboratory after freshamn year (summer 2019) and into the fall of 2019 as well as some independent projects related to Hopfield Networks. The work focused on simulating a reservoir computer and assessing its value for different applications. I'm currently expanding on my Hopfield network project with some work on restricted Boltzman machines. I'll be adding this progress soon.
