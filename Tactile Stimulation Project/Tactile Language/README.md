# Tactile Encoding Project

This sections contains work I did for an independent project during the spring of my sophomore year of college (spring 2020). The goal of the project was to develop a proof of concept system for teaching a person to associate different words with different electrical stimulation patterns. The system involved a Python script, Arduino firmware, and H-bridge circuit. I tested the system on a small number of people.
