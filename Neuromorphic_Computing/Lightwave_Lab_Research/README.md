# Lightwave Lab Research

This section contains research I performed for the Lightwave Communications Laboratory after my freshman year of college (summer 2019) and into my sophomore year. My work was performed in collaboration with Vikash Modi and supervised by Hsuan Tung-Pen. The goal of our project was to simulate a reservoir computer and assess its viability for different toy examples.
